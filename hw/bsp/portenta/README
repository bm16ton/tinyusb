The portenta has a arduino bootloader in stock configuration, wich requires an offset to be applied.
edit ldscript.ld and change start off rom;

FLASH (rx)      : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 2048K

to

FLASH (rx)      : ORIGIN = 0x08040000, LENGTH = 2048K

Depeding on libs being used how the scb vtor needs to be set can very.

but a generic-ish way is to add something to first line of main loop like so

### HAL add following includes;

#include "stm32h7xx_hal.h"
#include "stm32h7xx.h"

 ## and to main loop

SCB->VTOR = 0x08040000;

#####  or for libopencm3

#include <libopencm3/cm3/scb.h>

 ## and to main loop;

SCB_VTOR = (uint32_t) 0x08040000;


The portenta has an i2c pmic which see the mbed core sends commands to very early init. 

This will have to be looked at.




Currently after a firmwareware upload the portenta reboot 3 or 4 times with a few seconds in between

but after the initial upload it seems solid and never does it again even after unplug/replug.




Simple scripts to ease uploading firmware via the stock arduino bootloader can be found here;

Ill eventually post firmware snips for resetting to bootlader in general and more specifically

via 1200 baud request and improved tools.
